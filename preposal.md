# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Our team's goal is to create a function that allows the user to input a stock ticker and then outputs a multiples chart. The code will recognize what type of industry the company is apart of, which will determine which metric is used-- whether it be P/E, P/Bk, or EV/EBITDA. If time allows, we would like to create an additional component that would allow the user to input an initiating date and the function would output what the return would be. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

- Taylor Regensburger
- Anika Vilivalam
- Nick Bertel

## Do you have any questions of your own?

- How to connect Python and Bloomberg data pull?
- Do we create a graph using turtles and gridlines, or is there a more sophisticated option?
- How to label the graph properly, axis / scale?
- Can Python differentiate between a Financials or Consumer company using different valuation metrics (P/E or P/Bk)?
- What is the best way to properly format the data so its digestible for the user?
- If the user inputs a company that has been publicly trading for under the scale being used for other charts; how do we make the code automatically adjust?
