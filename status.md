Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have figured out how to install / use PyCharm and pandas to properly import the yfinance package, as we realized we were unable to do so in idle. From there, we were able to create a dictionary to begin sorting the data and instructing it to pull certain key metrics such as price, sector classification, and company name. We created 11 different "if statements" that correspond to each respective sector to indicate which type of valuation multiple the function should be outputting. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We will be creating a function that will properly chart the price data for each company. This will be slightly different from how we have used the turtle capabilities in past labs.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We originally intended to connect Python and Bloomberg for this project. Unfortunately, we were unable to bridge these two programs as the subscription offered by Temple University does not allow for that capability. As we sorted through the data provided by Yahoo Finance we realized it is not neccessary for us to have Bloomberg to complete this assignment.
